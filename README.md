# 2- Explain 3 different CSS selectors.
Universal Selector (*): it will apply to all elements on the HTML page. Element Type Selector: it must match all HTML elements of the same name. Such as a selector of <div> would match all HTML <div> elements. ID Selector: is declared using a hash (#) preceding a string of characters that is defined by the developer. Matches any HTML element that has an ID attribute with the same value as that of the selector. This selector quite inflexible, because the styles used in it can be used only once per page.

# 3- What is the difference between SessionStorage and LocalStorage in HTML5?
Session Storage is destroyed once the user closes the browser/web page whereas, Local Storage stores data with no expiration date until the user delete it.
